I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I dont contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit cause its in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, thats him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, yous a, yous a, yous a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone dont exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely dont tolerate the front
Shit Ive been through prolly offend you, this is Paulas oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters
Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldiers DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didnt have nowhere to stay
At 29, Ive done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like Im supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my powers here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, Im rollin several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all Im inheritin
Money and power, the makin of marriages
Tell me somethin
You mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when youre in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets, reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage, livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin, marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi, freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes, curvin all the fakes
Phone never on, I dont conversate
I dont compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder — our DNA
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon do to me
Confrontation aint nothin new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you cant bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I dont even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
and calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy cause I aint invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I dont even like you
Corrupt a mans heart with a gift
Thats how you find out who you dealin with
A small percentage, who Im building with
I want the credit if Im losing or Im winning
On my momma thats the realest shit
Girl, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin, I get involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, Got no result, Got to stay down
Its the way that you making me feel like nobody ever loved me
Like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you trying to get away from me
If you do I wont move
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the day, for the day,
for the hours and another way, another life breathin
I did it all cause it feel good
But woudnt do it all if it feels bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time
Lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer
Nobody pray for me
Its been that day for me
Waaaaay yeah, yeah!
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now Im countin this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, Im downin this
DUSSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, wont you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Its levels to it, you and I know
Who dat nigga thinkin that he frontin on Man-Man? Man-Man
Get the fuck off my stage, Im the Sandman Sandman
Get the fuck off my dick, that aint right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
Im so fuckin sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mamas couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I dont fabricate it, ayy, most of yall be fakin, ayy
I stay modest bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it wont be the alcohol, ayy
Im the realest nigga after all
Im always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
Its all the same
Im always ready to take a life again
You know Ill ride again
Its all the same ooh, ooh, ooh
Tell me whos gon save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me whos gon save me from this hell
Without you, Im all alone
Who gon pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gon die for you
If Im gon kill for you
Then Ill spill this blood for you, hey
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
Im tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid aint relief
Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? Hero
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? Hero
My heart dont skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin men
Clutchin on deaf ears again, rapture is comin
Its all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then thats what it gotta be
Who gon pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gon die for you
If Im gon kill for you
Then Ill spill this blood for you, hey
Who gon pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
Cause Im alone, you see
If Im gon die for you
If Im gon kill for you
Then Ill spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith go, I live by my own law
I live by my own law, I live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I live by my own law
I live by my own law, I live by my own
Pour up drank, head shot drank
Sit down drank, stand up drank
Pass out drank, wake up drank
Faded drank, faded drank
Now I done grew up round some people livin their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin to make a vow soon
That Ima get fucked up, fillin up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up drank, head shot drank
Sit down drank, stand up drank
Pass out drank, wake up drank
Faded drank, faded drank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that youre nauseous right now
And Im hopin to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
Ima drown in some poison, abusin my limit
I think that Im feelin the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin, the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, Im over-influenced by what you are doin
I thought I was doin the most til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up drank, head shot drank
Sit down drank, stand up drank
Pass out drank, wake up drank
Faded drank, faded drank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin only two or three shots?
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, Ima dive in it
Pour up drank, head shot drank
Sit down drank, stand up drank
Pass out drank, wake up drank
Faded drank, faded drank
Aw man… where is she takin me?
Where is she takin me?
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then youre like me
Makin excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin, why you laugh?
Dont you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That niggas straight, man, that nigga aint trippin
We gon do the same ol shit
Ima pop a few shots, they gon run, they gon run opposite ways
Fall right in ****s lap
And he gon tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, Im good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!
