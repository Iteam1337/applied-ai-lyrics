Ahhaha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, aaaah
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave made me shiver
Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ahhaha, it's a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Ahhaha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, aaaah
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back the pain?
Ahhaha, how can I forget that name?
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
Once he took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Ahhaha, ahaaaah
Ahhaha, ahaaaah
Ahhaha, keep thinking, ahaaaah
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Ahhaha, keep thinking, ahaaaah
Keep thinking, I had to pay the price
Making somebody happy
Is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so
Come on give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender,always will return to sender
Like a bang  a  bomm  a  bommerang
Dum  de  dum  dum, de  dum  de  dum  dum
Oh bang  a  boom  a  boomerang
Love is a tune you hum  de  hum  hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
Youll get love in return
So bang  a  boom  a  boomerang is love
A boom  a  boomerang is love
Love is always around and
You can look for it anywhere
When you feel that youve found it
My advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool,never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is that boomerang you're throwing
Yeah so bang  a  boom  a boomerang
Dum  de  dum  dum, de  dum  de  dum  dum
Oh bang  a  boom  a  boomerang
Love is a tune you hum  de  hum  hum
Well give it away, I think you'll learn
Youll get love in return
So bang  a  boom  a  boomerang is love
And if you're warm and tender
I kiss you return to sender please surrender
Bang  a  boom  a  boomerang
Dum  de  dum  dum, de  dum  de  dum  dum
Oh bang  a  boom  a  boomerang is love
A boom  a  boomerang is love
Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity, Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing though you're late that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in out sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I watched her ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in out sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world
As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world
Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys?
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
'there is something,' you said, 'that you may not know,
There's a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay,
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way.'
And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realise
It's a crazy world
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen
ou're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl you're only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)
But girl you're only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
We're not the stars of a hollywood movie
So what's the use to pretend
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy
You've gotta face it my friend
Dream world
You've been living in a dream world
Trust me
You just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we've gotta make it together
And we've made, it so far, so it can only get better
When you reach out
And you say to me 'how I love you girl'
When I hold you
Baby can't you see
It's a real dream world
You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white
Dream world
You've been living in a dream world
Trust me
You just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And we've made, it so far, so it can only get better
When you reach out
And you say to me 'how I love you girl'
When I hold you
Baby can't you see
It's a real dream world
Dream world
You've been living in a dream world
Trust me
You just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And we've made, it so far, so it can only get better
They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
High, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
Every good man needs a helping hand
so I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
and he knows what he's gonna get
when he's going too far
Living on the dark side once again
It's sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
Still we're going on
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry
Every good man needs a helping hand
It's true
Every good man needs a helping hand
so I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
and he knows
what he's gonna get
when he's going too far
Living on the dark side once again
It's sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
Still we're going on
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry
Every good man needs a helping hand
It's true
Can you hear the drums fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternity
I was so afraid fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando
Now we're old and grey fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the rio grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando...
Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
Noone to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T. V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
Noone to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...
There's not a soul out there
Noone to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
You say she's been mad at you
Then you say you'll be patient, ooh
Still I see that she makes you blue
Come on, I'll give you consolation
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right
You're all I ever need, my darling
Just to be where you wanna be
So much fun we could have then, hmm
To be close for eternity
What a miracle to happen
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you
I know she doesn't make it easy
'cause you don't please her like you please me
You're my life, you're my angel
You're my first, you're my last
Would she care if you lingered
For another night
Wanna hold you tight
We could make it right
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right
I know she doesn't make it easy
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you
You're all I ever need, my darling
And I would love to sing my love song
For you
There's a gentleness to everything you do
And it's rubbing off on me I feel it too
I've been waiting but my loneliness I get
When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over
Baby you know I will
I could never stay on my own
Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you
Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you
I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you
Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you
Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always givin' a little more
No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say...
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway...
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eightynine...
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and i
Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans ohooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance
Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honololu, a greeting from happy Hawaii
It's so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans ohooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance, mmm
I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ahaahaaaahah
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help some day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Ahaahaaaahah
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
You might need his help one day (he's your brother)
We depend on one another (brother)
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going (that we're going)
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
Love him, that's the only way.
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
You might need his help one day (he's your brother)
We depend on one another (brother)
Love him, that's the only way
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream  I have a dream
I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream  I have a dream
I'll cross the stream  I have a dream
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream  I have a dream
I'll cross the stream  I have a dream
I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Ahaahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Ahaahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Ahaahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, ooooh
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know,
My my, I could never let you go.
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, ooooh
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?
Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, ohoh
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
You were here and now you're gone
Hey did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, ohoh
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ohoh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
I'd like to dedicate this song to mother earth
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind
What ever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to feel so nice, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, well I try, how can I carry on?
You seem so far away but you are standing nearer
You make me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, ooh I try, how can I carry on?
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, ooh I try, how can I carry on?
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, ooh I try, how can I carry on?
In the night a new day dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Summer night city...
Summer night city...
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, lovemaking in a park
Summer night city
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancyfree
Aaahhh
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, lovemaking in a park
Summer night city
It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when the dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, lovemaking in a park
Summer night city
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(that's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me
We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(come on, give me a break will you?)
Take a chance on me
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
No I can't let go
Cause I love you so
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa baba
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean
Voulezvous (ahha)
Take it now or leave it (ahha)
Now it's all we get (ahha)
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulezvous (ahha)
Ain't no big decision (ahha)
You know what to do (ahha)
La question c'est voulezvous
Voulezvous
I know what you think
"The girl means business so I'll offer her a drink"
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd
I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game
Master of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean
Voulezvous (ahha)
Take it now or leave it (ahha)

My my, at waterloo napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo  I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo  promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo  couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo  knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo  finally facing my waterloo
My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving the fight up
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo  I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo  promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo  couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo  knowing my fate is to be with you
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo  I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo  promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo  couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo  knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo  finally facing my waterloo
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (suppper trouppper)
Smiling, having fun (suppper trouppper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (suppper trouppper)
Like I always do (suppper trouppper)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright 
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (suppper trouppper)
Smiling, having fun (suppper trouppper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (suppper trouppper)
Like I always do (suppper trouppper)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (suppper trouppper)
Smiling, having fun (suppper trouppper)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (suppper trouppper)
Like I always do (suppper trouppper)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (suppper trouppper)
Smiling, having fun (suppper trouppper)
Feeling like a number one
beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (suppper trouppper)
Like I always do (suppper trouppper)
