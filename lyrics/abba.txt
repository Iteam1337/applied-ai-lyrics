Ahhaha, keep thinking bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, aaaah
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave made me shiver
Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ahhaha, its a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and youre hypnotized
Hell take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Ahhaha, keep thinking bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, aaaah
Sometimes when Im lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back the pain?
Ahhaha, how can I forget that name?
Look into his angeleyes
One look and youre hypnotized
Hell take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
Once he took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Ahhaha, ahaaaah
Ahhaha, ahaaaah
Ahhaha, keep thinking, ahaaaah
Keep thinking bout his angeleyes
Ahhaha, keep thinking, ahaaaah
Keep thinking, I had to pay the price
Making somebody happy
Is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so
Come on give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Dont you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender,always will return to sender
Like a bang  a  bomm  a  bommerang
Dum  de  dum  dum, de  dum  de  dum  dum
Oh bang  a  boom  a  boomerang
Love is a tune you hum  de  hum  hum
By giving away, I think youll learn
Youll get love in return
So bang  a  boom  a  boomerang is love
A boom  a  boomerang is love
Love is always around and
You can look for it anywhere
When you feel that youve found it
My advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool,never ever be such a fool
Every feeling youre showing
Is that boomerang youre throwing
Yeah so bang  a  boom  a boomerang
Dum  de  dum  dum, de  dum  de  dum  dum
Oh bang  a  boom  a  boomerang
Love is a tune you hum  de  hum  hum
Well give it away, I think youll learn
Youll get love in return
So bang  a  boom  a  boomerang is love
And if youre warm and tender
I kiss you return to sender please surrender
Down in the street theyre all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity, Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you linger
Youre grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing though youre late that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in out sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I watched her ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in out sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I was out for the morning sun
Couldnt sleep so I thought Id take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like Ive never had before
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
Its a crazy world
As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didnt know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my lifes a part of you
And I just couldnt move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didnt know
What it was all about
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
Its a crazy world
Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys?
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
there is something, you said, that you may not know,
Theres a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother joe.
Hes been gone for a long long time
But hes back and I think hes gonna stay,
Youll be seeing a lot of him
Hes so nice in every way.
And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
And I realise
Its a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realise
Its a crazy world
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the musics high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine

Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life

So whats the use to pretend
Im not so charming and youre not so groovy
Youve gotta face it my friend
Dream world
Youve been living in a dream world
Trust me
You just cant escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesnt mean theyre in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, weve gotta make it together
And weve made, it so far, so it can only get better
When you reach out
And you say to me how I love you girl
When I hold you
Baby cant you see
Its a real dream world
You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesnt seem right

Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And weve made, it so far, so it can only get better
They came flying from far away, now Im under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
Theyve seen places beyond my land and theyve found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream Im an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, Im a bird in the sky
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
Theres no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
Is it true Im an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?
Flying high, high, Im a bird in the sky Im an eagle
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly what a feeling
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
And I dream Im an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, Im a bird in the sky Im an eagle
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly what a feeling
Over mountains and forests and seas
High, high, Im a bird in the sky Im an eagle
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly what a feeling
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
Every good man needs a helping hand
so I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
and he knows what hes gonna get
when hes going too far
Living on the dark side once again
Its sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
Still were going on
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Some of us learn too late, Im sorry
Every good man needs a helping hand
Its true
Every good man needs a helping hand
so I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
and he knows
what hes gonna get
when hes going too far
Living on the dark side once again
Its sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
Still were going on
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Some of us learn too late, Im sorry
Every good man needs a helping hand
Its true
Can you hear the drums fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternity
I was so afraid fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And Im not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando
Now were old and grey fernando
And since many years I havent seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the rio grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, fernando...
Half past twelve
And Im watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
Theres not a soul out there
Noone to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
Its so different from the world Im living in
Tired of T. V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But theres nothing there to see, no one in sight
Theres not a soul out there
Noone to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...
Theres not a soul out there
Noone to hear my prays
Wont somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
You say shes been mad at you
Then you say youll be patient, ooh
Still I see that she makes you blue
Come on, Ill give you consolation
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right
Youre all I ever need, my darling
Just to be where you wanna be
So much fun we could have then, hmm
To be close for eternity
What a miracle to happen
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you
I know she doesnt make it easy
cause you dont please her like you please me
Youre my life, youre my angel
Youre my first, youre my last
Would she care if you lingered
For another night
Wanna hold you tight
We could make it right
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right
I know she doesnt make it easy
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you
Youre all I ever need, my darling
And I would love to sing my love song
For you
Theres a gentleness to everything you do
And its rubbing off on me I feel it too
Ive been waiting but my loneliness I get
When you call me on the phone
And Im feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over
Baby you know I will
I could never stay on my own
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before
Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before
Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before
Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before
Im always givin a little more
No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
Its the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Nows the time for us to say...
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we dont we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks hell be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing hes astray
Keeps on going anyway...
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we dont we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
Its the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what well find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eightynine...
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we dont we might as well lay down and die
You and i
Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honololu, were going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honololu, were going to happy Hawaii
After all Ive had to go through
Im making no plans making no plans ohooh
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance
Guess Ive been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, Ill send you a card
From Honololu, a greeting from happy Hawaii
Its so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honololu, were going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honololu, were going to happy Hawaii
After all Ive had to go through
Im making no plans making no plans ohooh
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance, mmm
Ive got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebodys waiting and Ill forget you
Hey Honololu, were going to happy Hawaii
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ahaahaaaahah
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help some day
We depend on one another
Love him, thats the only way
On the road on the road that were going
We all need we all need words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, thats the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didnt care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Treat him well, he is your brother brother
You might need his help one day hes your brother
We depend on one another brother
Love him, thats the only way
On the road on the road that were going that were going
We all need we all need words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother brother
Love him, thats the only way.
Treat him well, he is your brother brother
You might need his help one day hes your brother
We depend on one another brother
Love him, thats the only way
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream  I have a dream
I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Aint it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
Thats too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldnt have to work at all, Id fool around and have a ball...
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich mans world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich mans world
Ahaahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
Its a rich mans world
A man like that is hard to find but I cant get him off my mind
Aint it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldnt fancy me
Thats too bad
So I must leave, Ill have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich mans world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich mans world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
Its a rich mans world
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich mans world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich mans world
Ahaahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
Its a rich mans world
Its a rich mans world
Ive been cheated by you since I dont know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I dont know how but I suddenly lose control
Theres a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, ooooh
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much Ive missed you
Yes, Ive been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know,
My my, I could never let you go.
Ive been angry and sad about the things that you do
I cant count all the times that Ive told you were through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you wont be away too long
You know that Im not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, ooooh
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much Ive missed you
Yes, Ive been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, its a game we play
Bye bye doesnt mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much Ive missed you
Yes, Ive been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
Its a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothings going right
Wont you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?
Yes Im down and feeling blue
And I dont know what to do, ohoh
Ring, ring, why dont you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Wont you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why dont you give me a call?
You were here and now youre gone
Hey did I do something wrong?
I just cant believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Wont you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, ohoh
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Wont you please understand the need in me
Id like to dedicate this song to mother earth
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind
What ever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to feel so nice, it used to be so good
So when youre near me, darling cant you hear me S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
When youre gone, how can I even try to go on?
When youre gone, well I try, how can I carry on?
You seem so far away but you are standing nearer
You make me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when youre near me, darling cant you hear me S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
When youre gone, how can I even try to go on?
When youre gone, ooh I try, how can I carry on?
So when youre near me, darling cant you hear me S.O.S.
In the night a new day dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothings worth remembering
Its a dream, its out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, lovemaking in a park
Summer night city
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I cant take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know whats waiting there for me
Tonight Im loose and fancyfree
When the night comes with the action
I just know its time to go
Cant resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, lovemaking in a park
Summer night city
Its elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We dont miss them when theyre gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere
When the night comes with the action
I just know its time to go
Cant resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when the dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothings worth remembering
Its a dream, its out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, lovemaking in a park
Summer night city
If you change your mind, Im the first in line
Honey Im still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If youve got no place to go, if youre feeling down
If youre all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey Im still free

Gonna do my very best and it aint no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as were together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
Cause you know Ive got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream Im alone with you
Its magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I cant let go
If you change your mind, Im the first in line
Honey Im still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If youve got no place to go, if youre feeling down
If youre all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey Im still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it aint no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me

Take a chance on me
Oh you can take your time baby, Im in no hurry, know Im gonna get you
You dont wanna hurt me, baby dont worry, I aint gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
Its magic
You say that I waste my time but I cant get you off my mind
No I cant let go
Cause I love you so
If you change your mind, Im the first in line
Honey Im still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If youve got no place to go, if youre feeling down
If youre all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey Im still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby cant you see

Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby cant you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa baba
Honey Im still free
Take a chance on me
Im nothing special, in fact Im a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, youve probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
cause everyone listens when I start to sing
Im so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs Im singing
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And Ive often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, Im a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs Im singing
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Ive been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs Im singing
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Giving out a spark

My my, at waterloo napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo  I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo  promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo  couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo  knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo  finally facing my waterloo
My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving the fight up
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue
Like I always do
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear youre coming glad to hear youre coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And suddenly its gonna be
And its gonna be so different
When Im on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue super trouper
Like I always do super trouper
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still Im thinking about you only still Im thinking about you only
There are moments when I think Im going crazy think Im going crazy
But its gonna be alright 
Youll soon be changing everything
Everything will be so different
When Im on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun super trouper
Smiling, having fun super trouper
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue super trouper
Like I always do super trouper
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
So Ill be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me Im still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know its gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun super trouper
Smiling, having fun super trouper
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue super trouper
Like I always do super trouper
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun super trouper
Smiling, having fun super trouper
Feeling like a number one
beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue super trouper
Like I always do super trouper
